Basic Syntax of an Output Block

```
output "name_of_output" {
  value = <expression>
  description = "Optional description of the output"
  sensitive = <true|false>   # Optional: Hide sensitive data
}

```

name_of_output: 

The name of the output variable (a string).

value: 

This is the expression whose result we want to display. It can reference any resource or variable.

description (optional): 

A brief explanation of the output value, which helps us understand its purpose.

sensitive (optional): 

If true, this prevents the output from being displayed in plain text in the Terraform plan/apply output.

# Output EC2 Instance ID

aws_instance.ec2-test.id: 

This references the id attribute of the aws_instance resource named ec2-test.

value = aws_instance.ec2-test.id: 

The value of the output will be the instance ID of the created EC2 instance.
description: 

This is an optional field that describes what this output value represents (i.e., the instance ID).

# Output Multiple Values (IP Address & Instance ID)

We can output multiple values at once. For example, we may want to output both the instance ID and the public IP address of an EC2 instance.

# Using Sensitive Outputs

Sometimes, we may want to output sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or tokens, but we donâ€™t want these values to be displayed in plaintext in the terminal. Terraform allows us to mark outputs as sensitive using the sensitive argument.

A random password is generated using the random_password resource, and the password is marked as sensitive.

To see the value of the sensitive output, we can use the terraform output command, but we'll need to use the -json flag to view it in a machine-readable format.
