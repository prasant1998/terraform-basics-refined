The toset() function in Terraform is used to convert a given collection (like a list or a set) into a set type. 
A set in Terraform is an unordered collection of unique elements. When we use toset(), Terraform removes any duplicate elements and converts the collection into a set.

This function is especially useful when we need to ensure that no duplicates are present or when we need to pass a set to a resource or module that requires set-type inputs.

# Removing Duplicate CIDR Blocks in Security Group Ingress Rules

We have a list of CIDR blocks, and we want to ensure there are no duplicates in the set of CIDR blocks we pass to a security group.

The cidr_blocks variable contains a list with duplicate CIDR blocks ("10.0.0.0/24" appears twice).

We use toset(var.cidr_blocks) to convert this list into a set, which removes the duplicate entries.

In the aws_security_group_ingress resource, for_each is used to create a rule for each unique CIDR block.

# Ensuring Unique Tags

We have a list of tags for an AWS resource, but we want to ensure that there are no duplicate tags being applied, we can convert the list of tags into a set.

The tags variable is a list that contains some duplicate tags (e.g., "Environment=dev" appears twice).

By using toset(var.tags), we convert the list into a set, which automatically removes the duplicate "Environment=dev".

We then use the split("=", tag) function to separate the key and value of each tag and assign them to the tags block.
